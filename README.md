# Objective
Here, our goal is to disentangle the images by taking as input the sum of the two images. For example, given image A & B, input to our model is A+B and the output is A,B

## Exp 1
Tried two samplers: Random sampler and SingleImg sampler. In first, a batch comprises of two random samples. (/home/ubuntu/ashesh/training/disentangle/2202/D2-M3-S2-L0/0)
In second a batch comprises of 1 image and other random samples. (/home/ubuntu/ashesh/training/disentangle/2202/D2-M3-S2-L0/1)
I see that the second approach had better results. however, in both cases, best performance is achived at epoch 1.
which is very strange? 

There was a bug in the validation error due to which I'm re-running the configs.
